# Connect4 Game

This is a Python implementation of the Connect4 game. It allows you to play against an AI opponent that uses the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to make intelligent moves.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python (version 3.7 or higher)
- NumPy library

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the source code files.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

## How to Play

1. The game is played on a 6x7 grid.
2. You will be playing as the 'O' player, and the AI will be playing as the 'X' player.
3. The goal is to be the first to connect four of your own pieces vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.
4. On your turn, enter the column number (1-7) where you want to make your move.
5. The AI will then make its move and the game will continue until either a player wins or the game ends in a draw.

To start the game, run the following command:

## Acknowledgments
This Connect4 game implementation is based on the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. It was developed as a demonstration of AI game-playing strategies.
